## Engineering Best Practices

The following is a collection of team adopted best practices. Upon agreement, feel free to submit a PR with updates.

### Code Review Standards

1. Code reviews are important. Great code reviews help level up the software we create, and most important the value we deliver. See this [wiki with details on how to conduct excellent code reviews](https://wiki.doximity.com/articles/effective-code-reviews).

### Git Commit Standards

1. Refrain from force-pushing as it overrides useful history on changesets, commits, and commit messages which can be useful for debugging issues in the future.
